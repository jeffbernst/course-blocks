This is an open source site for building and enrolling in courses. It is built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery for the front end, and Node/MongoDB for the back end. My plan is to rebuild the front end in React after the initial iteration is complete. Please visit [this post](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@jeffbernst/course-blocks-first-post-and-back-end) for more information about the project.

If you'd like to copy or fork this repo, there are only a few changes you'll have to make to get it up and running. 

- First run `npm install` to get all of the node modules installed. 
- After that it's just a matter of updating the branding and styling however you like!

It is currently in development -- more details to come soon!
